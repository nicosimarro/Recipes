        <ol>
            <li>
                Season the chicken with salt and pepper and brown it in the tagine with a splash of oil. 
                We turn it over so that it browns well on all sides, remove and reserve
            </li>

            <li>
                Add a little more oil if necessary, and fry the chopped onion, pepper and garlic.
            </li>

            <li>
                When the vegetables are cooked, salt them, put the chicken back, add the Ras el Hanout
                (or the mixture of spices that you are going to use), the cinnamon and anise, 
                approximately 2 glasses of water, cover and let cook over low heat for 20 minutes       
            </li>

            <li>
                Add the plums and dried apricots, if we see that it is a little dry,
                add a little more hot water, stir, cover 
                again and cook for 15 more minutes.         
            </li>

            <li>
                To prepare the couscous, in a saucepan, 
                heat the water or chicken broth. When about to boil,
                but before it boils, turn off the heat, add the couscous 
                taking care that it is completely submerged in the liquid,
                cover and let stand for 5 minutes
            </li>

            <li>   
                After this time, with a fork we shell the couscous 
                so that it loosens, we add it to the tagine, stir and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
