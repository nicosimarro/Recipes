        <h2 id="steps">Preparation steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Sauté the onions, garlic and celery – 
                finely chopped – in the lower pot with olive oil
            </li>

            <li>
                Add the coriander and parsley -chopped-, cinnamon, ras el hanout,
                black pepper and a pinch of saffron, fry for 5 minutes
            </li>

            <li>
                Add the meat cut into pieces, brown it for 10 minutes. 
                Cover with hot water and add the chickpeas -soaked for 12 hours-, 
                cover with the hole pot and leave the content to cook over low heat
            </li>

           

            <li>
                Wash the couscous, let it drain, season with a splash of oil, black pepper, 
                ground cumin and salt. Put it in the strainer pot from the moment the steam begins to pass through the holes.
            </li>

            <li>
                From time to time – every 15 minutes – transfer the couscous to a serving dish and stir gently with a fork,
                moistening it with water and oil and returning it back to the strainer pot. 
                Repeat the operation three times.
            </li>

            <li>
                After 45 minutes of cooking, add the cabbage cut 
                into large pieces and cook for 30 minutes. 
                Add a chopped onion and chilli peppers – optional –
                and leave to cook for 20 more minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add the aubergine, the peppers, the potatoes, 
                the tomatoes and the turnips, all chopped. 
                Check the salt and pepper and cook another 20 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Spread the couscous on a tray, cover with the meat, 
                chickpeas and vegetables. 
                Pour the broth into a tureen and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
