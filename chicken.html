        <p id="recipe-introduction">
            Chicken with olives and lemon is a very typical recipe of Moroccan cuisine that is usually prepared in a tajine,
            a container made of baked clay, and made up of a deep plate and a conical lid where numerous dishes are made. 
            If you don't have it, you can do it in any pot, as in this case.

        <p id="recipe-description">
            the tajine is one of the most characteristic delicacies of Morocco that receives the name of the container where it is prepared.
             It is a round and shallow clay pot with a particular conical lid, 
             designed to preserve the juiciness and flavors of the food that gives rise to aromatic and succulent stews. 
             Although the varieties are endless and they are also prepared with vegetables, fish and meat such as lamb... one 
             of the most classic tagines is this chicken tagine with lemon and green olives.
